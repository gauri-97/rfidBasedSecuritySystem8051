The aim of the project is to check the RFID tag, along with a password associated with the tag, to secure the system. 

When a person put his RFID tag to RFID reader then RFID reads tag’s data and send it to 8051 microcontroller and then microcontroller compares this data with pre-defined data. If data is matched with predefined data then microcontroller ask for password and after entering password microcontroller compare password with predefined password. If password matches, the gate will open. Otherwise the LCD shows “Access denied” and the buzzer starts beeping.


Just burn the code into your 8051 microcontroller and properly connect the lcd, rfid reader and keypad and your security system would be working perfectly
